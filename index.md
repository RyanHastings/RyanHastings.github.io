In 2019, I left research meteorology to enter data science. No longer interested in academia, I sought to apply my skillsets of analyzing data, formulating hypotheses regarding that data, and testing those hypotheses to a wider array of fields. This has been a thoroughly enjoyable career pivot, as I have worked on a variety of different problems, which so far have included behavioral economics, epidemiology, and record linkage. All of the work I did is confidential to the government agencies that commissioned the work (and often covered by HIPPA or FERPA), but here I will showcase some of the types of work I did. Within this portfolio I will walk through some common data science problems, as well as explore some interesting questions and techniques that I do not commonly see.

At this point I have only completed one of the portfolio projects:
- [Classification Model With Numerical Features](portfolio-1/index.md)

***Philosophy on the use of LLMs for coding.*** Large language models are here, and anyone not willing to use them for help on coding problems is not using a potentially powerful tool. In my own experience, I have found ChatGPT helpful for a few things: If I'm particularly stuck on a problem, if I foresee that solving a problem will take longer than is reasonable for getting a project done with some celerity, or if I have come up with a solution but find it clunky and am curious if there is a more elegant solution (and usually there's not, at least not one that the LLM can come up with). In my experience, though, the suggestions given by the LLM need to be vetted rigorously with a human mind. It is not uncommon for there to be extraneous lines of code, or something incorrect that I will need to look up. In general, LLMs often help as a conversation partner. I did use ChatGPT to assist with the code in this portfolio, as well as its conversion via quartz. The former it was generally helpful for, the latter it proved a significant impediment.

**Future Work** will include the exploration of classification models that mix numerical and categorical features, strategies for handling missing values, and using SHAP values for investigating interactions in a model agnostic way.
